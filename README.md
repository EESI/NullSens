R-function for Partitioning Abotic and Biotic Variation of Community Data

Publication Description: It is well known that both abiotic factors and biotic interactions structure ecological communities. However, the relative importance of these factors in controlling community composition is openly debated and may have profound implications for management of communities and our ability to predict community responses to perturbations. Statistical methods typically used for analysis of abiotic factors search for correlation between community composition and abiotic gradients using ordination and regression techniques, whereas methods for detection of biotic interactions primarily rely on assessing patterns of presence/absence. Thus, there is a lack of unified statistical methods for simultaneous analysis of biotic and abiotic factors controlling community composition. We have developed a unified method that employs a nullmodel based on existing species covariation models to assess community-wide biotic covariation after removing individual species responses to environmental gradients (i.e. abiotic factors). Analytical output from the method provides the percentages of the variation that can be explained due to abiotic, biotic and unexplained factors. Within the biotic variation results, the algorithm also outputs if it detects positive, negative, or mixed community covariation. Our method can be used to verify hypotheses on species interactions when environmental gradients are present. We demonstrate the performance of the method by a) sensitivity analysis over a variety of parameters on simulated species responses and b) two published ecological datasets.
